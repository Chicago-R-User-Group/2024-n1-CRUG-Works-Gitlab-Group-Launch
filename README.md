# CRUG Works Gitlab Group Launch

February 29, 2024, 5:30 PM - Hybrid Meetup

On this Leap Day on the unofficial 24th birthday of R, we present our new working initiative to engage with CRUG members in the Git & Gitlab environment.

CRUG Works Gitlab Group provides a public, welcoming, and collaborative space for any member (beginner to expert, hobbyist or professional) to share and showcase their R work across the many use cases of the open source environment: API and extensions, apps and tools, data science, devops, visualization, help docs and tutorials. And across any domain or subject matter.

Members are invited to sign up to be a Gitlab developer in our new group, come learn or re-learn how to leverage version control for better analysis and fork, branch, commit, pull, push, and send merge requests to an open source project.

## Sponsors

[The Chicago R User Group (CRUG)](https://www.meetup.com/chicago-r-user-group/) will host this event. Roosevelt University will provide the meeting site. Zoom will provide the online meeting.
